    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <h3>
        <p>
        Rainforest Rescue was created by a small group of concerned college students who wanted to make a large scale impact. We hope to not only to inform about the dangers that Earth&#39;s rainforests are facing, but to inspire our readers to make a difference in their own communities as well. 
        </p>
        <p> Even the smallest contribution to our cause goes a long way - all donations to Rainforest Rescue will go right into informational online advertising and the development of an in-person information session to teach students and the community about how they can better care for the world we live in.
